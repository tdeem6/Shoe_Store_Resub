#####  MySql exercise for Epicodus, 8/19/2015

#### By Tyler Deem

## Description

Allows user to enter a list of local shoe stores.  Also allows user to add multiple shoe brand names to a particular shoe store.

##Disclaimer

Has errors in tests, made twig templates that have a few broken links. Ran out of time debugging tests, will need to resubmit this weekend.

##Setup

1. Clone this repository using the command `git clone [link-to-your-repository]`.
2. Change directory into the top level of the project folder.
3. Install Composer (https://getcomposer.org) and then run the command `composer install` to download the Silex and Twig vendor files.
4. Setup mySql database. For how to use MAMP:
   :Enter $ /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -uroot -proot
   :Run servers in MAMP
   :Go to phpMyAdmin
   :Import shoe_store.sql and shoe_store_test.sql from project folder in Github.
5. Change directory into the `web` folder and start your server. For example, using PHPâ€™s built-in server: `php -S localhost:8000`
6. Navigate your browser to the home page at the root address. For example: `http://localhost:8000`.
